<p>The API is accessible using HTTP or HTTPS. HTTPS should be used to avoid browser warnings if the application making requests is served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>All responses are formatted in JSON (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation</a>). Responses are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip" target="_blank">gzipped</a> when possible. Include an <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code> header in your requests to enable this and reduce bandwidth usage by 60 to 90%, depending on the size of the response.</p>
<p>You can specify sites to allow cross-site requests from for each project. For instance, adding <code>www.example.com</code> as an allowed referrer will cause <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: www.example.com</code> to be included in the headers of your API responses.</p>
