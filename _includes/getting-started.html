<p>First, <a href="https://api.asg.northwestern.edu/manage/login/">log in</a> and apply for a key. Your request should be reviewed within 48 business hours. For now, each project is allotted 10,000 API requests per day. All of your requests to the API must include your key using the <code>key</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The base URL for the Course Data API is:</p>
<pre>
http://api.asg.northwestern.edu/
</pre>
<p>To retrieve data from the API, send an HTTP GET request to the base URL + an endpoint. For instance, pasting <code>http://api.asg.northwestern.edu/terms/?key=YOUR_KEY</code> in your browser will return a string in JSON representing a list of terms. (Using a browser extension such as JSONView during development is highly recommended.) Making the same request would look like this using JavaScript with jQuery:</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var params = {
  key: YOUR_KEY
};

$.getJSON('http://api.asg.northwestern.edu/terms/', params, function(data) {
  // data is the JavaScript array that results from parsing the response
  console.log(data);
});
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Using Python with the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">requests</a> library:</p>
{% highlight python %}
import requests

params = {
  'key': YOUR_KEY
}
response = requests.get('http://api.asg.northwestern.edu/terms/', params=params)
# calling response.json() returns the response as a Python dictionary or list
print response.json()
{% endhighlight %}
<p>You can find clients for various languages under the <a href="https://github.com/northwesternapis">GitHub organization</a> for this project. As of this writing, there are Python and Ruby wrappers available.</p>
